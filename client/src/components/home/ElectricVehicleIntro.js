            <h2>What is meant by an electric vehicle?</h2>
            <p>
                An electric vehicle (EV) uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. It may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a battery, solar panels, fuel cells or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity.
